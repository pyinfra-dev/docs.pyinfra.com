Pkg Operations
--------------


Manage BSD packages and repositories. Note that BSD package names are case-sensitive.

:code:`pkg.packages`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install/remove/update pkg packages. This will use ``pkg ...`` where available
(FreeBSD) and the ``pkg_*`` variants elsewhere.

.. code:: python

    pkg.packages(packages=None, present=True, pkg_path=None)

+ **packages**: list of packages to ensure
+ **present**: whether the packages should be installed
+ **pkg_path**: the PKG_PATH environment variable to set

pkg_path:
    By default this is autogenerated as follows (tested/working for OpenBSD):
    ``http://ftp.<OS>.org/pub/<OS>/<VERSION>/packages/<ARCH>/``. Note that OpenBSD's
    official mirrors only hold the latest two versions packages.

    NetBSD/FreeBSD helpfully use their own directory structures, so the default won't
    work.

Example:

.. code:: python

    pkg.packages(
        name='Install Vim and Vim Addon Manager',
        packages=['vim-addon-manager', 'vim'],
    )
