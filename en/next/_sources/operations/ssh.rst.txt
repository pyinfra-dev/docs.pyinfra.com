Ssh Operations
--------------


Execute commands and up/download files *from* the remote host.

Eg: ``pyinfra -> inventory-host.net <-> another-host.net``


Facts used in these operations: :ref:`facts:files.File`, :ref:`facts:files.FindInFile`, :ref:`facts:server.Home`.

.. _operations:ssh.command:

:code:`ssh.command`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Stateless operation
    :class: important

    This operation will always execute commands and is not idempotent.


Execute commands on other servers over SSH.

.. code:: python

    ssh.command(hostname, command, user=None, port=22)

+ **hostname**: the hostname to connect to
+ **command**: the command to execute
+ **user**: connect with this user
+ **port**: connect to this port

**Example:**

.. code:: python

    ssh.command(
        name="Create file by running echo from host one to host two",
        hostname="two.example.com",
        command="echo 'one was here' > /tmp/one.txt",
        user="vagrant",
    )


.. _operations:ssh.download:

:code:`ssh.download`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download files from other servers using ``scp``.

.. code:: python

    ssh.download(
        hostname, filename, local_filename=None, force=False, port=22, user=None,
        ssh_keyscan=False,
    )

+ **hostname**: hostname to upload to
+ **filename**: file to download
+ **local_filename**: where to download the file to (defaults to ``filename``)
+ **force**: always download the file, even if present locally
+ **port**: connect to this port
+ **user**: connect with this user
+ **ssh_keyscan**: execute ``ssh.keyscan`` before uploading the file


.. _operations:ssh.keyscan:

:code:`ssh.keyscan`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check/add hosts to the ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file.

.. code:: python

    ssh.keyscan(hostname, force=False, port=22)

+ **hostname**: hostname that should have a key in ``known_hosts``
+ **force**: if the key already exists, remove and rescan

**Example:**

.. code:: python

    ssh.keyscan(
        name="Set add server two to known_hosts on one",
        hostname="two.example.com",
    )


.. _operations:ssh.upload:

:code:`ssh.upload`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Stateless operation
    :class: important

    This operation will always execute commands and is not idempotent.


Upload files to other servers using ``scp``.

.. code:: python

    ssh.upload(
        hostname, filename, remote_filename=None, port=22, user=None, use_remote_sudo=False,
        ssh_keyscan=False,
    )

+ **hostname**: hostname to upload to
+ **filename**: file to upload
+ **remote_filename**: where to upload the file to (defaults to ``filename``)
+ **port**: connect to this port
+ **user**: connect with this user
+ **use_remote_sudo**: upload to a temporary location and move using sudo
+ **ssh_keyscan**: execute ``ssh.keyscan`` before uploading the file
