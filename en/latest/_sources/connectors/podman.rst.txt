``@podman`` Connector
---------------------

The Podman connector allows you to use pyinfra to create new Podman images or modify running
Podman containers.

.. note::

    The Podman connector allows pyinfra to target Podman containers as inventory and is
    unrelated to the :doc:`../operations/docker` & :doc:`../facts/docker`.

You can pass either an image name or existing container ID:

+ Image - will create a new container from the image, execute operations against it, save into         a new Podman image and remove the container
+ Existing container ID - will execute operations against the running container, leaving it         running

.. code:: shell

    # A Podman base image must be provided
    pyinfra @podman/alpine:3.8 ...

    # pyinfra can run on multiple Docker images in parallel
    pyinfra @podman/alpine:3.8,@podman/ubuntu:bionic ...

    # Execute against a running container
    pyinfra @podman/2beb8c15a1b1 ...

The Podman connector is great for testing pyinfra operations locally, rather than connecting to
a remote host over SSH each time. This gives you a fast, local-first devloop to iterate on when
writing deploys, operations or facts.
